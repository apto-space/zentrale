# Project context
- We are using bun instead of npm
- prefer a functional or imperative style over object-oriented
- Explain changes only briefly after completing
- always await nextJS page params
- use bun:test for unit tests
- do not install new packages unless prompted to do so

# DATABASE
- The db schema is at @default.esdl. Read it carefully and respect it.
- the database is called 'gel' (formerly edgedb). Prefer 'gel' commands, but in case they aren't found, you can use edgdeb
- gel database types include only
- NEVER write migrations by hand
