# Project context
- We are using bun instead of npm
- The db schema is at [default.esdl](mdc:dbschema/default.esdl). Read it carefully and respect it.
- gel is the database, it's previously called 'edgedb'
- gel database types include only
- prefer a functional or imperative style over object-oriented
- Explain changes only briefly after completing
- always await nextJS page params
- use bun:test for unit tests
- do not install new packages unless prompted to do so
